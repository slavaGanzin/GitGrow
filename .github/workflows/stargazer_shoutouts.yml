# .github/workflows/stargazer_shoutouts.yml
name: GitGrow Shoutouts (Manual)
# This workflow is used to run the GitGrowBot stargazer shoutouts script.
# It is triggered manually by maintainers only.
# The script processes the stargazers of the repository and generates shoutouts.
# It fetches the current state from the tracker-data branch, runs the shoutouts script,
# and commits the updated state back to the tracker-data branch.
# The shoutouts include welcome and farewell comments for stargazers.
