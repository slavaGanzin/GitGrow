# .github/workflows/run_autostarback.yml
name: GitGrow StarBack (Scheduled)
# This workflow is used to run the GitGrowBot autostarback bot on a schedule.
# It is triggered four times per day and can also be run manually.
# It checks for new stars on repositories and stars back users who have reciprocated within 4 days or who are stargazers.
# The results are committed to the tracker-data branch and uploaded as an artifact.

  schedule:
    - cron: '20 2,10,18,26 * * *'  # Fine for most users. If you expect >100 new stargazers per day, increase run frequency or set a stricter per-run limit to avoid GitHub API rate limit stalls.
