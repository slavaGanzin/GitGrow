# .github/workflows/run_autounstarback.yml
name: GitGrow UnstarBack (Scheduled)
# This workflow runs your autounstarback bot on a schedule.
# It is triggered four times per day and can also be run manually.
# It checks for users who have not reciprocated stars after 4 days and unstars them accordingly.
# The results are committed to the tracker-data branch and uploaded as an artifact.

  schedule:
    - cron: '20 3,11,19,5 * * *' # Fine for most users. If you expect >100 new stargazers per day, increase run frequency or set a stricter per-run limit to avoid stalls.
