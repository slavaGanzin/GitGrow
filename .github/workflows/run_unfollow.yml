name: GitGrow Unfollow (Scheduled)
# This workflow is used to run the GitGrowBot unfollow bot on a schedule.
# It is triggered by a cron schedule and can also be run manually.
# The workflow is designed to run the unfollow bot.
# The unfollow bot is responsible for unfollowing users who do not follow back.
# The follow bot is run in a different workflow (run_follow.yml) to keep the workflows separate.

#     # - cron: '5 */10 * * *'   # every 10 hours at XX:05 UTC
